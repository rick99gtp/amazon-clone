# Getting Started with Create React App

I created this project so that I could get a better understanding of how to use React Router (Link and useHistory), React Redux, Firebase User Authentication, shopping carts, and payment systems. For now, I am putting a hold on learning payment systems so I can continue to familiarize myself with React Router and React Redux in other projects.

In this project, you can sign up as a new user and sign in/sign out as a current user. Products can be added to the cart with the total number of items updated. Clicking on the cart brings you to your shopping cart which displays all of the products that were added. The number of items and the total price is displayed.
