I created this project so that I could get a better understanding of how to use React Router (Link and useHistory), React Redux, Firebase User Authentication, shopping carts, and payment systems. For now, I am putting a hold on learning payment systems so I can continue to familiarize myself with React Router and React Redux in other projects.

In this project, you can sign up as a new user and sign in/sign out as a current user. Products can be added to the cart with the total number of items updated. Clicking on the cart brings you to your shopping cart which displays all of the products that were added. The number of items and the total price is displayed.

## Technologies Used

## Problems Faced

Styling the pages wasn't any problem. Most of the tasks that were required to create this project just required a little research and reading the docs.

## What I learned

I continue to say this but I don't think it hurts to repeat myself. The more I learn about React, the more I absolutely love it. React Router has some really nice utilities that can make things easier. Redux state management isn't that bad once you get used to how it works. I don't think I would use it for smaller projects, but I would assume that with larger projects it's necessary.

## Takeaways

This was such a great project to learn many different important things at once. My mind is now accelerating to create other projects using React and Firebase. I think this is my third React app, but by far my favorite.

While this was a learning experience, I know that this should be developed for mobile first. At the time of this writing (10/14/2021), it is not styled for mobile. At all. Don't even bother, it's just...not good!  ;)  I will be taking care of this at some point in the future.

Thanks for reading.
