# Getting Started with Create React App

I created this project so that I could get a better understanding of how to use React Router (Link and useHistory), React Redux, Firebase User Authentication, shopping carts, and payment systems. For now, I am putting a hold on learning payment systems so I can continue to familiarize myself with React Router and React Redux in other projects.

In this project, you can sign up as a new user and sign in/sign out as a current user. Products can be added to the cart with the total number of items updated. Clicking on the cart brings you to your shopping cart which displays all of the products that were added. The number of items and the total price is displayed.

## Technologies Used

  * Router
  * Redux

  * userAuth - for User Authentication

## Problems Faced

Styling the pages wasn't any problem. Most of the tasks required to create this project just required a little research and reading of the docs. One source was instructing me to do things a certain way, however Firebase updated to Version 9, so I read the docs to change to the new way of doing things.
